READ ME: CMSC 123 SPR 2014 Prototype Joan Wang: Last Update 5/6/14

1. README_PROTOTYPE: this file.
2. proto_hmm.py contains python code for the prototype. It takes in energy data for a house and outputs a FHMM Model to fit the circuit. To run, type: "python proto_hmm.py home2_data_transpose.csv"
3. home2_data_transpose.csv is one of the data files included in the data set. It contains all of the energy data for all of the circuits in house 2. I'm using it to test the prototype; when it works well, I'll write new code that can run multiple houses at once.
4. REDD FHMM.pptx: Powerpoint to clarify for ourselves the model used in the REDD paper which we are trying to replicate.
5. Joan_HMM_Interpretation.pptx: Powerpoint to clarify for ourselves how the HMM works; keeps track of my research.
